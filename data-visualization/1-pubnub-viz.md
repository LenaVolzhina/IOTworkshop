## First Dashboard

You can now locally open the (dashboard)[humidity-and-temperature.html]. Feel free to experiment with this.. it's java script using the EON PubNub project.

Let's publish this page!

The simplest way to do this, as it is a static page is using [github pages](https://hackernoon.com/use-custom-domain-with-github-pages-2-straightforward-steps-cf561eee244f).

- After you create your repo,
- clone it locally,
- you can add the page humidity-and-temperature.html to it
- rename it index.html
- push the code
