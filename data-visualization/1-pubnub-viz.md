## First Dashboard

You can now locally open the [dashboard](humidty-and-temp-line.html) in your browser. Feel free to experiment with this.. it's written in java script using the EON PubNub project.

#### Let's publish this page!

The simplest way to do this, as it is a static page is using github pages following the instructions [here](https://hackernoon.com/use-custom-domain-with-github-pages-2-straightforward-steps-cf561eee244f).

These are a few things you will need to do specifically in our case:
- Create a new repo on Github (Step one in the article),
- clone it locally,
- Copy the file [humidity-and-temperature.html](humidty-and-temp-line.html) to it
- rename it index.html
- push the code to github (Step two in the article)
- you can now continue following the insrtuctions in the linked article
